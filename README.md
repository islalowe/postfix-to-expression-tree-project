# Expression Tree Project
This project implements an expression tree that can be built from a postfix arithmetic expression. The expression tree supports various operations including tree traversal, evaluation, and a step-by-step evaluation output.

## Features
 **Tree Construction**: Build an expression tree from a postfix arithmetic expression.
- **Traversal**: Supports inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the arithmetic expression stored in the tree.
- **Step-by-Step Evaluation**: Outputs a step-by-step evaluation of the expression in JSON format.
